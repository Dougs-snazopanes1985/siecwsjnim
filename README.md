Bro, just walked outta the theater and my mind’s like scrambled eggs, half-cooked but still runny, you know? Death of a Unicorn really messed with my head, like, did I even 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 a   or was it one of those fever dreams? The theater was noisy AF, some dude kept rustling his popcorn like he was digging for treasure, so annoying man.

The opening scene was like bam! Right there! This unicorn galloping through a misty forest, except it felt like a glitchy video game – all choppy and weird. Could barely keep up with who was who, everything was just jumbled, like when you try decoding last night's party after a bad hangover. 

> Midway through, some character had this monologue about life and time, all existential and deep but in a way that tied my brain in knots, like trying to unravel earphones from a pocket – the ones with all the versatile tangles. That dude next to me finally stopped crunching on that never-ending popcorn or maybe I was just too absorbed, like pouring milk over a phone instead of cereal.

Who even writes this crazy stuff? One moment there's a sad violin playing and the next there's a freakin' unicorn chase scene that feels like a cat video on 2x speed. Oh! And someone told me I should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   after cuz apparently, it has “layers.” Heard that before with those cakes, but who has the time to dissect it?

And did they actually say what killed the unicorn? Was it metaphorical? Literal? Or just left in the shadows like an unpaired sock at the bottom of a laundry bin? Oh, man. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you dare, but don’t ask me to explain it. I'm still picking popcorn crumbs from my hoodie pocket. 

The whole thing left this echo, kinda like when you're yelling in a tunnel, but nobody’s around to hear you. Can’t decide if it was art or just beautifully chaotic – or if I’m just trying to sound smarter than I actually am. 

Did I mention there was like a gorilla in a tutu at some point? Or was that my popcorn-fueled imagination going rogue? Either way, totally worth every bemusing moment. I’d say more but my back’s aching like I sat wrong for the entire 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮.
